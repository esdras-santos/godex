# GoDex

GoDex is a DAO that aims to be a hub for DeFi applications and to enable this to happen GoDex uses the [diamond proxy pattern](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535#diamond-interface)
which allows the addition of new functionality to the DAO. Right now GoDex have the options to swap between token-to-token ckb-to-token and token-to-ckb. The UI is not working fully but a public url to see the work that has been done until now is available and you can check that [here]():
